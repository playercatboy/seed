# Example Seed server configuration supporting encrypted clients
# This configuration demonstrates a server that can handle both
# encrypted and non-encrypted proxy connections

# Note: The server automatically detects and handles encryption
# based on the client's configuration. No additional server-side
# encryption configuration is needed beyond enabling the feature
# in the build and ensuring the proper authentication is in place.

# The server will:
# - Accept both encrypted and non-encrypted connections
# - Decrypt UDP packets from encrypted clients before forwarding
# - Encrypt UDP packets before sending back to encrypted clients
# - Handle TLS/SSH handshakes for TCP connections (when implemented)
# - Log encryption status for each client connection
